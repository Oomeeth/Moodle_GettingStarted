# How to extending a custom theme from Boost
- Create a folder inside of `/themes` folder. Call it `custom`.
- Create a script `/themes/custom/customversion.php`. This will contain information about our theme
  - Add the following code:
    ```  
    <?php
    // Every file should have GPL and copyright in the header - we skip it in tutorials but you should not skip it for real.
    
    // This line protects the file from being accessed by a URL directly.                                                               
    defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();                                                                                                
    
    // This is the version of the plugin.                                                                                               
    $plugin->version = '2020081701';                                                                                                    
    
    // This is the version of Moodle this plugin requires.                                                                              
    $plugin->requires = '2020061501.00';                                                                                                   
    
    // This is the component name of the plugin - it always starts with 'theme_'                                                        
    // for themes and should be the same as the name of the folder.                                                                     
    $plugin->component = 'theme_custom';                                                                                                 
    
    // This is a list of plugins, this plugin depends on (and their versions).                                                          
    $plugin->dependencies = [                                                                                                           
        'theme_boost' => '2020061500'                                                                                                   
    ];
    ```
  - Ensure that `$plugin->requires` matches the version of your Moodle installation, which is located at the root directory within `version.php`.
- Create a language file within `/theme/custom/lang/en/theme_custom.php`. The strings located within this file will be translated and displayed in our Moodle theme.
  - Add the following code:
  ```
    <?php
    // Every file should have GPL and copyright in the header - we skip it in tutorials but you should not skip it for real.
    
    // This line protects the file from being accessed by a URL directly.                                                               
    defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();                                                                                                
    
    // A description shown in the admin theme selector.                                                                                 
    $string['choosereadme'] = 'Theme custom is a child theme of Boost. It adds the ability to upload background customs.';                
    // The name of our plugin.                                                                                                          
    $string['pluginname'] = 'custom';                                                                                                    
    // We need to include a lang string for each block region.                                                                          
    $string['region-side-pre'] = 'Right';
  ```
- Our moodle theme requires 2 images: `/theme/custom/pix/favicon.ico` which will be displayed in the address bar and `/theme/custom/pix/screenshot.jpg` which will be displayed in the theme selector.
- Create a script `/theme/custom/lib.php`. This script contains callbacks which are used by various APIs in Moodle. We will leave this empty for now.
- Create a script `/theme/custom/config.php`.
  - Add the following code:
  ```

  ```
- Run the theme and test it out. It should work as normal. It will look the same as Boost theme.
- You can inherit changes from Boost settings so that any changes made to Boost will not affect Custom. The recommended way to do this is to create a theme settings script in the child theme that matches the settings in the parent theme. You will need to add matching language strings for each of these settings in the language file.
  - Create `/theme/custom/settings.php`. You will see these settings once you install the theme, or in `Site Administration > Appearance > Custom`.
  - Add the following code:
  ```
    <?php
    
    // Every file should have GPL and copyright in the header - we skip it in tutorials but you should not skip it for real.
    
    // This line protects the file from being accessed by a URL directly.

    // This is used for performance, we don't need to know about these settings on every page in Moodle, only when                      
    // we are looking at the admin settings pages.

    }                                                                                                                                       
  
    return $scss;                                                                                                                   
  }
```
  - This will get the `scss` styling file and return it `$THEME->scss` in `/theme/custom/config.php`.
- We will now add a setting which will allow us to upload a background image to the login page
- In `/theme/custom/settings.php` replace the last line `$settings->add($page);` with:
```
// Login page background setting.                                                                                               
// We use variables for readability.                                                                                            
$name = 'theme_custom/loginbackgroundimage';                                                                                     
$title = get_string('loginbackgroundimage', 'theme_custom');                                                                     
$description = get_string('loginbackgroundimage_desc', 'theme_custom');                                                          
// This creates the new setting.                                                                                                
$setting = new admin_setting_configstoredfile($name, $title, $description, 'loginbackgroundimage');                             
// This means that theme caches will automatically be cleared when this setting is changed.                                     
$setting->set_updatedcallback('theme_reset_all_caches');                                                                        
// We always have to add the setting to a page for it to have any effect.                                                       
$page->add($setting);
$settings->add($page);
```
- Add the following to the end of `/theme/custom/lang/en/theme_custom.php`:
```
// Background image for login page.                                                                                                 
$string['loginbackgroundimage'] = 'Login page background image';                                                                    
// Background image for login page.                                                                                                 
$string['loginbackgroundimage_desc'] = 'An image that will be stretched to fill the background of the login page.';
```
- We need to update the theme to set this image background on the login page. In `/theme/custom/lib.php`, replace `return $scss;` with the following:
```
// Pre CSS - this is loaded AFTER any prescss from the setting but before the main scss.                                        
$pre = file_get_contents($CFG->dirroot . '/theme/custom/scss/pre.scss');                                                         
// Post CSS - this is loaded AFTER the main scss but before the extra scss from the setting.                                    
$post = file_get_contents($CFG->dirroot . '/theme/custom/scss/post.scss');                                                       
 
// Combine them together.                                                                                                       
return $pre . "\n" . $scss . "\n" . $post;
```
- Create 2 `scss` scripts: `/theme/custom/scss/pre.scss` and `/theme/custom/scss/post.scss`.
  - We need to be able to style our background image on the login page. Add the following code to `/theme/custom/scss/post.scss`:
  ```
    body.pagelayout-login {                                                                                                             
    background-image: url([[pix:theme_custom|loginbackgroundimage]]);                                                                
    background-size: cover;                                                                                                         
    }
  ```
- Add the following to the end of `/theme/custom/lib.php` which will store our uploaded background image:
```
function theme_custom_update_settings_images($settingname) {                                                                         
    global $CFG;                                                                                                                    
 
    // The setting name that was updated comes as a string like 's_theme_custom_loginbackgroundimage'.                               
    // We split it on '_' characters.                                                                                               
    $parts = explode('_', $settingname);                                                                                            
    // And get the last one to get the setting name..                                                                               
    $settingname = end($parts);

    $syscontext = context_system::instance();                                                                                       
    // This is the component name the setting is stored in.                                                                         
    $component = 'theme_custom';

    // Get an instance of the moodle file storage.

        foreach (glob($pathpattern) as $filename) {                                                                                 
            @unlink($filename);                                                                                                     
        }                                                                                                                           
 
        // Copy the current file to this location.                                                                                  
        $file->copy_content_to($pathname);                                                                                          
    }                                                                                                                               
 
    // Reset theme caches.                                                                                                          
    theme_reset_all_caches();                                                                                                       
}
```
- Finally, replace the last method `$setting->set_updatedcallback('theme_reset_all_caches');` from `/theme/custom/settings.php` with `$setting->set_updatedcallback('theme_custom_update_settings_images');`.
- Reinstall the theme and have a look at the settings page. You can now upload a background image for the login page.
  - Alternatively, go to `Site Administration > Appearance > Custom` **AFTER** switching to Custom theme.
